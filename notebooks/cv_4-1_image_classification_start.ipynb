        "\n",
        "This tutorial provides an introduction to PyTorch and TorchVision. We'll learn how to: load datasets, augment data, define a multilayer perceptron (MLP), train a model, view the outputs of our model, visualize the model's representations, and view the weights of the model. The experiments will be carried out on the MNIST dataset - a set of 28x28 handwritten grayscale digits.\n",

We will move on to the CIFAR10 dataset - 32x32 color images in ten classes. We show: how to define architectures using nn.Sequential, how to initialize the parameters of your neural network, and how to use the learning rate finder to determine a good initial learning rate.\n",

However, instead of training the model from scratch we will instead load a VGG model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and show how to perform transfer learning to adapt its weights to the CIFAR10 dataset using a technique called discriminative fine-tuning. We'll also explain how adaptive pooling layers and batch normalization works.\n",

We'll show how to load your own dataset, using the CUB200 dataset as an example, and also how to use learning rate schedulers which dynamically alter the learning rate of your model whilst training. Specifially, we'll use the one cycle policy introduced in this paper and is now starting to be commonly used for training computer vision models."
